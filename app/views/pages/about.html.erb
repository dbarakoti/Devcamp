      <p>I have just join a coding school named "Bottega" and i have joined thousands of 
					developers with a passion and willingness to learn various programming languages. Since, in my school, the core programming language is Ruby, i am learning various syntaxes and methods of ruby. In addition, rails being a powerful framework to implement ruby, this portfolio is a result of the awesome combination of ruby, rails and styling languages.</p>

				<p> I have been in a business management field in a quite a long time but my passion to become a 			professional developer has never become weaker. This is the main reason i am here right know. 		Feel free to email me by going to my contact page if you have any specific questions or 	concern. </p>
